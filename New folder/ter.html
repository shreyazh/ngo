        <h2>Current Status of Child Education in India</h2>
       
        <p>Child education plays a crucial role in shaping the future of a nation. In India, however, there are still significant challenges that hinder access to quality education for all children.</p>
       
        <p>Despite progress made in recent years, a considerable number of children in India are out of school or receive inadequate education. Factors such as poverty, gender inequality, and lack of infrastructure contribute to this issue.</p>
       
        <p>According to recent statistics, the enrollment rate for primary education in India stands at 95%, with a gender disparity of 4% between boys and girls.</p>

            <img src="graph_country.PNG" alt="Enrollment Statistics Chart">
        </div>
       
        <p>To address these challenges, initiatives focused on providing equal educational opportunities, improving infrastructure, and promoting inclusive policies have been implemented. However, there is still a long way to go to ensure every child in India receives quality education.</p>
       
        <p>At ISHA, we are committed to making a difference. Through our programs, we aim to increase access to education, enhance the quality of teaching, and create a conducive learning environment for children across India.</p>
       
        <p>By investing in the future of our children, we can build a stronger and more prosperous nation.</p>
